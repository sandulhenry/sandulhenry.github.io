Hi! My name is Sandul, and I am currently a third year undergraduate student at University of California, San Diego. I am studying Computer Engineering, in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Jacobs School of Engineering

At UCSD, I take part in an undergraduate design team, [Yonder Dynamics](https://yonderdynamics.org/#/). I take part in the embedded systems subteam, connecting the arm to the rest of the system enabling motor control. I am currently working as a [research assistant](https://sscf.ucsd.edu/ssrde) at the School of Global Policy, under Professor Elizabeth Lyons, doing data analytics onboard a batch cluster computer. My interests within the field lie in robotics, digital signal processing, and personally, astronomy.

My hobbies include swimming, going to the gym, snowboarding, coaching youth swim team, and having making fun projects with Raspberry Pis.
